## Set-Up

#### Google Cloud Console (API Setup)

1. To get started, head over to the Google Cloud Console website and create a new project.
2. Click on 'API & Services' and 'Enable APIs and Services'.
3. Search and enable both 'YouTube Data' and 'YouTube Analytics' API.
4. Return to the API & Services page and click on 'credentials'.
5. Click Create Credentials -> OAuth Credentials -> Desktop Application -> Go through setup.
6. Download the JSON file, name it `CLIENT_SECRET.json` and place the file inside the same folder as the program.
7. Create Credentials -> API Key -> Copy and assign the key to the `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Discord Bot

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/ and create a new application. Name it YouTube Apprise or whatever you wish, accept the terms.
2. Open the application -> OAuth2 -> URL Generator.
3. Within Scopes, click 'Bot' and enable the desired bot permissions.
4. Enable text permissions such as Send Messages & Read Message History. 
5. Enable general permissions such as View Server Insights.
6. Copy the generated link below Permissions and enter it in a browser. Add the bot to your server of choice (preferably your own private Discord server, as sensitive information such as revenue and CPM is accessible through bot commands).
7. (Optional) Add a pretty profile picture for your bot in Rich Presence.
8. Go to 'Bot' to obtain, reset, and retrieve the token. Assign it to the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Installation

The bot can be run using Python or Docker.
#### Python Script
1. Clone this repository, cd into it, and install dependancies:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/youtube-analytics-bot
   cd youtube-analytics-bot
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python main.py
   ```
#### Docker Container
Build with Docker only after running locally and generating a `credentials.json` file
1. Run script locally with Python to generate credentials json file.
2. Download and install Docker on your system
3. Configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
4. To build the image yourself, cd into the repository and run:
   ```sh
   docker build -t youtube-apprise .
   ```
   Then start the bot with:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name youtube-apprise youtube-apprise
   ```
   Both methods will create a new container called `youtube-apprise`. Make sure you have the correct path to your `.env` file you created.

5. Let the bot log in and begin working. DO NOT PRESS `CTRL-c`. This will kill the container and the bot. To exit the logs view, press `CTRL-p` then `CTRL-q`. This will exit the logs view but let the bot keep running.
